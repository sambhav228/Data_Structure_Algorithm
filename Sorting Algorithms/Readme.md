# Sorting Algorithms

This repository consists of various Sorting Algorithms.

## Insertion Sort

One of the simplest methods to sort an array is an insertion sort. An example of an insertion sort
occurs in everyday life while playing cards. To sort the cards in your hand you extract a card, shift
the remaining cards, and then insert the extracted card in the correct place. This process is
repeated until all the cards are in the correct sequence. Both average and worst-case time is O(n2).
