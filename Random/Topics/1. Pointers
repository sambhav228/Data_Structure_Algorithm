## Dangling pointers

C++ does not make any guarantees about what will happen to the contents of deallocated memory, or to the value of the pointer being deleted. 
In most cases, the memory returned to the operating system will contain the same values it had before it was returned, 
and the pointer will be left pointing to the now deallocated memory.
A pointer that is pointing to deallocated memory is called a dangling pointer. Dereferencing or deleting a dangling pointer will lead to undefined behavior. 


## Null pointers and dynamic memory allocation

Null pointers (pointers set to address 0 or nullptr) are particularly useful when dealing with dynamic memory allocation. 
In the context of dynamic memory allocation, a null pointer basically says “no memory has been allocated to this pointer”. 
This allows us to do things like conditionally allocate memory
